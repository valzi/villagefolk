# Village Folk RPG

by Michael R. Bacon. 

Inspired by endless other stuff, but mostly B/X and the Goblin Laws Of Gaming.

Feedback requested!

# Incomplete sections

Please contact me if you can help with any of the following:

* The equipment list isn't ready to use.
* Classes need updating.
* The Random Starting Items table is barely even started.
* The advice sections are almost entirely stolen without credit from random places. I think it's great advice, but I need to replace it with my own or with something that is credited.
* The Professions table is just stolen. It needs to be replaced.

## Structure of Document Sections

> Formulas and summary notes which are useful if you've already read. They're also good for copying and pasting onto a GM screen.

Full length explanation.

------

Examples and advice.

## Project Goals

1. A rules document that focuses on quick and easy reference, especially for experienced players.
2. Remove rules whose benefit is not worth the hassle, especially if they're about combat. Minimize bookkeeping.
3. Flavor/guidance will be kept to a minimum until the rules are in place.
4. 

## To-do

1. Create a professions table.
2. Create a death and dismemberment table.
3. Fork a set of rules that fits my setting. (This probably won't happen until a lot more of my content is written - maybe a long time from now.)

## Notes

Very GLOG-gy. Many of the mechanics are from http://goblinpunch.blogspot.ca/2016/05/the-glog.html by Arnold k. and https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2018/01/osr-glog-based-homebrew-v01-rat-on.html by Skerples. 

# Adventuring Rules

## Doors

> Heavy doors = 1 Exploration turn to open. Likely to shut.

Typically, doors in a dungeon are heavy.

Heavy doors require 1 exploration turn to open and are likely to swing shut if not wedged open. 

### Stuck Doors

Doors have a 2 in 6 chance of being stuck. A stuck door will only open on a successful STR check.

---

### Wedging Doors

Doors may be held open or closed using iron spikes or other wedges. 

---

Wedging doors open can allow for a much quicker escape. Instead of spending one turn (about ten minutes) per door, characters can just walk through an open passage.

Wedging doors shut can create a safe space to sleep in when exploring a dungeon. It can keep monsters from wandering through the room the player characters are in while they loudly dig a tunnel through a wall.

## Drunkenness

Typically, every alcoholic drink beyond the first adds one point of drunkenness, but this will depend on the Constitution of the character and on the alcoholic content of the drink.

Each point of drunkenness expands the critical failure range by 1 until morning.

---

Joe has a fairly standard Constitution. He drank 3 beers, so his critical failure range has expanded by 2 points to 18-20. If he rolls an 18 during a check, he'll critically fail the check.

---

## Hit Dice

A Hit Die (HD) is a d8 unless otherwise specified.

Hit Dice can be used to determine the hit points of a non-player character or a monster. (See below.) 

They can also be used to grant an ATK bonus to non-player character or monster. The number of HD a monster or non-player character may usually be considered equal to their level.

### Hit Points from Hit Dice

To determine Hit Points of a non-player character or monster, do whichever the following you prefer:

1. Check the monster's stats to see if they have a specific number of hit points. If they do, this is the best method.
2. Multiply the number of hit dice by 4 (or by 5 to create stronger enemies.) This is fast, simple, and consistent.
3. Roll all of the hit dice and use the total. This is the most traditional method. It's very random, which is less consistent and less predictable for players and referee.

### Bonus ATK from Hit Dice

A non-player character or monster gets a bonus to ATK equal to their number of Hit Dice (unless they are assigned a specific bonus in their stat block or description.) 

A monster with 3 HD would have a bonus of +3.

### Ability Scores derived from Hit Dice

A non-player character or monster has a default ability score equal to 10 + HD when an ability score is needed for an opposed check.

A monster with 3 HD usually has 13 Strength, 13 Dexterity, 13 Intelligence, etc.

Modify their ability scores as needed, when appropriate. A gigantic, rampaging hippo with 2 HD probably doesn't have an intelligence as high as 12, for example. 

## Holding Breath

A character can hold their breath for combat rounds equal to CON÷2.

If the character is physically prepared, they may hold their breath for combat rounds equal to CON.

---


## Sleep Deprivation

> Less than 8 hours sleep in a day = -1 to all rolls. Cumulative -1 each day.

---

## Starvation

For every 24 hours without food, save against Constitution to prevent one Constitution point being lost.

Without water, save against Constitution to prevent Constitution being halved.

After the third time, die.

> Recover Constitution lost in this way at double the usual ATR recovery rate with rest and food.



---

## Treasure

PCs can evaluate raw metals and they count directly as CP, SP, or GP.

Thieves and other similarly - minded experts can INT check to evaluate other standard-valued items (like gems.)

## Encounters, in Dungeons

The probability of encountering an enemy in a dungeon or other similar locale is usually specific to that locale. If it is not assigned, adventurers encounter monsters when rolling a 6 on a D6.

# Checks

## Check

> **Stat Check**: roll a D20 equal to target value or under target value.

Sometimes, the referee might ask a player character to make a check against a stat. For example, MOVE might be checked to attempt to jump over a pit or STR might be checked to attempt to push a heavy or stuck object.

To check a stat, a player rolls 1D20 and, if the result is less than or equal to the stat (this is the "Target Number"), the check succeeds. If the roll is greater than the ability, the check fails.

An unmodified (natural) roll of 1 is always a success and a natural 20 is always a failure, regardless of penalties and bonuses.

------

Example: A player character checks their MOVE stat to jump over a pit. The player character has a move score of 12 but the pit is dangerously wide, so the Referee imposes a +2 penalty. The player rolls a 12. This would normally be a success, but the penalty means that the result is a 14. The player character falls into the pit.

## Penalties and bonuses

Whenever a player makes a check, bonuses or penalties may be applied to the target number, with a modifier of +3 resulting in a much easier check and a -3 resulting in a much more difficult check. Just use -3, -2, +2, and +3. Other numbers are for very unusual circumstances.

------

Miranda has a character named Sammi. Sammi's target foe is not visible (perhaps a human hiding in an unlit room.) The referee assigns a -10 penalty to Sammi's ATK. This means that, even though Sammi's sheet says that her ATK is 11, in the dark, her ATK is only 1. This means the player would need to roll a 1 to succeed at hitting the enemy.

However, imagine this: Miranda says "Sammi is going to wait to swing her sword until she hears something standing near her, paying attention to the direction of the sound. She will swing the sword wide, in a circle." The Referee might now change the penalty to just -2 if the foe is not taking care to be quiet, but if she misses, she'll hit someone else in her party, if they don't hurry to get out of the way.

Add a Cover example. 

A PC hiding behind a door might get a +3 to defensive rolls. A PC hiding behind a 4' tall rock might only get +2.

### Bonus and Penalty guide

| +3        | +2   | -2        | -3             |
| --------- | ---- | --------- | -------------- |
| Very Easy | Easy | Difficult | Very difficult |

------

## Opposed Stat Check

> **Opposed Check: ATR + [10-Opposing ATR]**

An opposed check is a check that has a penalty (or bonus) based on an opposing force. The target number to roll under is the sum of the player character's relevant attribute score and 10 minus the opposing attribute.

------

To quickly simulate a game of chess against a very wily wizard, an opposed intelligence check might look like this:

Player Character intelligence: 10. 
Wizard intelligence (as defined by the referee at the moment the check is made): 18.

ATR + [10-Opposing ATR] = opposed check
10 + [10-18] = opposed check
10 + [-8] = 2 = opposed check

In this case, the player must roll a 1 or 2 to succeed at the opposed check and win the game of chess.

If the player character has a "Games" Tag or if the player character finds a way to distract the wizard, a bonus to the check would be gained.

If the wizard is being pleaded with by an urchin claiming to be his son, the referee might decide to award a bonus of 2 to the check. Now the player character only needs to roll 4 or under to succeed.# Combat Rules

## Encounter Procedure

1. The referee may determine if either party is surprised by the other (by circumstance or by a roll - see *Surprise*, below) and determines how far away the creatures or persons of unknown disposition are.
2. Players must roll initiative (see **Combat Procedure**.)
3. The referee determines the reaction to the party (usually with a **Reaction Check**.) The players decide how their characters will act:
4. A. If both parties wish to talk, they may.
   B. If the player party decides to flee, the referee determines whether the other party pursues (usually with a Morale Check.)
   C. If combat occurs, follow the **Combat Procedure**.

## Combat Procedure

1. Check **Morale** if enemy is outnumbered,outclassed, or reduced to half STR (in number or HP.)
2. Initiative (**WIS**) check. Success = act before enemy. Fail = act after. Act in order of rolls, lowest to highest.
3. After initiative has been determined, the party may decide to spend their turns fleeing (see **Chases**) instead of taking **Combat Actions**.
4. **6 second turn**. Take one **Combat Action**. Some minor actions (like looking at the enemy) do not take a significant amount of time and may be used in addition to a character's combat action.

### Combat Duration

A combat encounter takes at least one full turn (about ten minutes.) This includes recovery time.

### Encounter Distance

An encounter usually occurs at the maximum range the player party can see. 

Enemies might attack before this, at their range, if they can see the players, but no encounter begins because the player party does not encounter the enemy.

### Surprise

> 1D6. 1 = gain surprise. 6 = be surprised. **Surprise** = +4 ATK & act first on round 1.

If there is a chance that either party is surprised, roll 1D6. If the result does not fit the situation, ignore it.

If a 1 is rolled, the player characters surprise the opposition.
If a 6 is rolled, the opposition surprises the players. 

A party that has surprise will act 1st on round 1 without need for an initiative check and gain +4 ATK for round 1.

If one party carries a light source and the other party does not, the party without a light source may not be surprised. (Most creatures who live underground can see in the dark, however, so they may not need to carry a light source.)

### Monster or NPC reaction

When someone is encountered, the referee may request that a reaction be rolled by whichever party member is in front.

| **2d6**      | 2       | 3-5               | 6-8         | 9-11       | 12      |
| ------------ | ------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------- |
| **Reaction** | Helpful | Somewhat Friendly | Instinctual | Aggressive | Hostile |

### Chases

> Opposed Check **MOVE**  against enemy's move to **pursue or flee**. 
>
> [Difference between result and MOVE]' = steps gained/lost.
>
> 5 steps away = evaded pursuers.
>
> If pursuers catch party, pursuers have initiative.

1. Before anything else, a pursued may drop an item. If it is something a pursuer desires, roll morale to see if the pursuer stops pursuit to take the item.
2. To flee or pursue, the slowest member of the player party does an opposed MOVE Stat check against the enemy's MOVE.
3. Find the difference between the rolled result and the MOVE score. The player party gains that many "steps"* if they succeed. The enemy gains that many "steps" if they succeed. 
4. **A.** If the pursued are 5 steps ahead, they've lost the pursuers. If the player party has successfully fled, check the enemy's morale to determine whether they search for the player party.
   **B.** If the pursuers catch up to the pursued, the chase is over and the pursuers automatically win initiative.

*A "step" is usually about 10'.

------



## Combat Actions

### Attack

> **Attack**: ATK score - Enemy DEF = Target Number. Result: Hit or grapple.
>
> **DEF** = 10 + worn armor.  Defend = check DEF - enemy HD.

An attack is an attempt to hit with a weapon or an attempt to grapple. If a 20 is rolled, check weapon for **Breakage**.

A fumble when defending results in an armor **Breakage** check. 

------

## Criticals

### Critical Successes

 A roll of a natural 1 in combat is a Critical Success. This grants a free combat maneuver or an additional roll of the damage die.

### Critical Failure

> Check for breakage if ATK roll or DEF roll = natural 20.

> **Fragile** weapons always break.
> **Standard** weapons = 3-in-6 chance on d6. All weapons are Standard unless specified otherwise.
> **Masterwork** weapons= 1-in-6 chance on d6. First break = -1 to ATK. Second break = useless.

> **Armor break** = -1 to DEF per break. Useless when penalty equals the bonus.

### More crits

Count all 20 and higher sums as critical failures instead of just a natural 20. Count all 1 and lower as critical hits.

### Enemy Defense

> **Enemy Defense**. If you're using enemies with a Descending Armor Class from another game, you can convert that number to enemy defense by subtracting 10.
> A descending Armor Class (AC) of 18 is the same as a defense of 8. Exception: Lamentations of the Flame Princess increases the base AC from 10 to 12. To convert AC in Lamentations of the Flame Princess to Defense, subtract 12.
>
> 

>  Ben Milton's phrasing in Knave: "Monster AC (if ascending) is identical to Armor defense. If the AC is descending, subtract it from 19 (if it has Original or B/X AC) or from 20 (if it has 1st edition or 2nd edition AC) to find its ascending equivalent. ""

> **Enemy Attack**. 8 is incompetent. 11 is standard. 15 is great.

#### Non-lethal Attacks

Non-lethal damage may be dealt if a player announces their intent before making the attack. This results in a penalty to the attack and/or damage roll (usually -1 to each.)

#### Damage Rolls

> **Light weapons** 1D6 + Str MOD DMG. Throwable (- 1 ATK for every 10' beyond the first 10'.)

> **Medium weapons** 1D6 + STR MOD DMG or 1D8 + STR MOD DMG with two hands.

> **Heavy weapons** 1D10 + STR MOD DMG, two hands. Not usable in confined spaces. 2 Slots.

> **Improvised Weapons** = -2 ATK.

> **Slings** = 1D6 DMG. -1 ATK for every 20' beyond the first 20'. Share Slot with up to 3 stones. Stones can always be gathered with a few minutes.

> **Bows** 1D6 DMG. -1 ATK for every 30' beyond the first 30'.

> **Crossbows** 1D10 DMG. -1 ATK for every 40' beyond the first 40'. Reload costs one turn.

> **Fists and feet** 1 + STR MOD DMG

------



### Combat Maneuvers

> **Combat Maneuvers**: Shove, trip,disarm, grapple, and other opposed stunts.

> 1. Check ATK - target's HD.
> 2. **Fail** = target hits player character.
> 3. **Regardless**, make opposed ATR check. **Success** = maneuver occurs.

------

### Grapple

> **Grapple: **Tie = nothing happens. Wait for next combat round.
>
> **Defender wins** = stuns attacker.
>
> **Attackers win**= defender is pinned and helpless.

------

### Retrieve Item from Backpack

> **Retrieve** from backpack = 1D3 combat rounds.

------



## Combat Special Cases

### Appropriate weaponry

You may add a bonus damage die (of the weapon’s type) to the roll if you attack an enemy from hiding or use the ideal weapon against an enemy type . Multiple bonuses results in multiple extra damage dice.cked

------

Using a blunt weapon against a skeleton grants one extra damage dice. Using a silver sword dipped in holy water against a vampire grants two extra damage dice. Using a silver sword dipped in holy water against a vampire who doesn't know he is being attacked grants three extra damage dice.



### Attacking from Behind

> **Attack from behind = +2 bonus ATK. If from STEALTH, check DEX or STR. 

> Fail = x2 DMG.
> Success = 3x damage.

------

## Fire

> **On Fire**: Take 1D6 DMG per Combat Round. Extinguishing uses one Combat Round (DEX check.)

## Initiative

> **Initiative** check = **WIS** check.
> Success = act before enemy. Fail = act after.

> Act in order of rolls, lowest to highest.

## Morale, Enemy

### Morale Checks

> 2D6 under Morale. Success = enemy enemy flees or surrenders. If Morale = 12 never succeed.

Check **Morale** if the enemy is outnumbered, outclassed, or reduced to half STR (in number or HP.)

------

## Morale, Hireling

> **Retainer Morale** = 2D6 under Morale.
> Success = hold ground. Failure = flee or surrender.

------

## Multiple Attackers

A 10' wide hallway allows two characters to fight side-by-side.# Conversation

At the start of a conversation encounter, every PC must make a Charisma check. The lowest successful roll goes first.

After every successful PC has taken a conversation action, those who failed the Charisma roll may take conversation actions.

The first PC to act makes a reaction roll (2d6.) That roll is compared to the reaction table to determine how the NPC reacts.

The result also determines how many conversation actions the party may attempt before the NPC is done talking and wants to end the conversation. The referee should note this number down in a place visible to the players, if possible. (Example: If the NPC reacts with a 7, the players get 7 conversation actions.)

If the players force a conversation to continue past the point that an NPC wishes to leave, their reaction will be reduced by 2 for each round they are kept against their wishes. If their reaction reaches 2, the NPC will end the conversation in annoyance, hostility, or an outright attack.

## Conversation Reaction Table

| **2d6** | **Reaction Category** | **Conversation Actions** |
| ------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 2       | Attack                | None                     |
| 3-5     | Hostile               | -2                       |
| 6-8     | Indifferent           | 0                        |
| 9-11    | Talkative             | +2                       |
| 12      | Helpful               | +4                       |

Every communication will fall into one of four basic categories: **Banal, Give, Take, and Convince**.

Once an action is resolved, the referee reduces the number of remaining actions by 1.

## Banal

Simple conversation, most questions, and other minutia. There is no chance to fail.

## Convincing

Telling a lie which the NPC has cause to doubt or making an argument against something the NPC believes.

**<6:** Displeased. Reaction drops by 1 *category*. **6:** Unconvinced. **9:** Trepidatious. Will think about it. **11:** Fully convinced.

Situational modifiers of 1 or 2 may occasionally apply. Players who expect something in exchange for nothing should take a penalty; players who offer much in exchange for little should get a bonus.

## Giving

Telling a joke, offering compliments, giving gifts, listening to a person’s long winded opinions, etc. When giving, roll 2d6 and add relevant modifiers.

**<6:** Unimpressed. **6:** Interested. +2 conversation actions. **9:** Intrigued. +1 to next Taking or Convincing attempt. **11:** +1 to your reaction with this NPC.

## Taking

Making a request or a demand, negotiating, offering a bribe, asking questions the NPC may not be inclined to answer.

**<6:** upset. reaction drops by 1 *category*. **4:** refusal. **6:** meet halfway. **9:** agrees. **11:** agrees and offers more.

### Intimidation

Modifies the result by the difference in average level between the two groups. Receive a bonus or penalty of 1 for each level.

### Bribe

The baseline bribe for an NPC is equal to 250GP*level. (Level 0 NPCs have a baseline bribe of 100GP.) 
For each social/wealth "level" an NPC has above "commoner," add a 0 to the end of the result.

Increasing or decreasing this amount by 50% will modify the *taking* result by +/- 2.

Example: for a level 2 character, the baseline bribe is 500 gp. Increasing or decreasing this amount by 50% (750 gp or 250 gp) will modify the *Taking* result by +/- 2.Nothing here yet!## Death and Dismemberment (Goblin Punch Version 26)

When you take damage in excess of your HP, you roll on the Death Table. Roll d20 + excess damage and look up the result on the table.

 Natural 1 = Regain 1d6 HP. Gain a cool scar.

 5 or less = Prone and Disarmed.

 6-15 = Knocked Out. Beaten for 1 day.

 16-25 = Dying. Beaten for 1 day. Gain an ugly scar.

 26+ = Dead 

**Magical Healing**

Magical Healing always restores your HP from the regular floor of 0 HP, eliminating any Knocked Out or Dying conditions. (A character healed for 3 HP will be left at HP 3.) You remain Beaten, however.

### Scars

 No effect beyond the cosmetic. Write them down on the back of your character sheet.

### Beaten

 -2 to Attack rolls.

•             20% spell failure chance.

•             When you roll on the Death Table, add +10 to your result.

### Knocked Out

 At the end of each combat round, make a DC 11 Con check.

–          If you succeed, you wake up. (You are still Prone and Disarmed.)

–          If you roll a natural 1, you lose a point from a random stat. 

•             If anyone spends a standard action tending to you, you wake up.

### Dying

 At the end of each combat round, roll a d20.

–          Natural 1: you lose two points from a random stat.

–          2-9: you lose a point from a random stat.

–          Natural 20: your condition improves to Knocked Out.

–          If you've lost more than two stat points from this injury, you die.

•             Anyone can attempt to stabilize you with a -7 Int check. Once you are stabilized, your condition improves to Knocked Out.

•             Getting dropped to dying is probably going to be at least 3 turns of downtime: one round spent getting out of Dying, one round getting out of Knocked Out, and one round standing up and recovering your dropped sword.## Exploding Damage Die

All damage die explode. (when their highest value is reached, a second damage die with the same number of sides will be rolled and added to the result.)## Overland Travel

### Overland Encounter Table

**Random Travel Encounters (d6)**

**1. Monster Event** (assign scenarios to monsters for players to discover)

**2. Monster Omen Event** (A sign that a creature is nearby)

**3. Non-Combat Event (not during night)** (Usually npcs, often with a hook/problem.)

**4 Mundane Event** (Mostly interpersonal conflict/friendship in party.)

**5-6 (none)**

## Disease

### Catching a Disease

Keep track every time a player is exposed to a disease: each bite from a dire rat, or each time they open a sarcophagus. You can also be exposed to a disease by touching a person who is infected, or spending too much time in close proximity.

The next morning, each character who was exposed must make a Con check. Multiple exposures incur cumulative penalties (-1 per subsequent exposure.) If they fail, they suffer the normal effects of the disease and are considered infected. It they pass, they suffer no effects and are not infected. 

### Suffering a Disease's Effects

Every subsequent morning, an infected character will make a Con check against the disease. If they fail this check, they take the listed ability score damage.

This damage will not recover naturally until the disease is cured. (Ability score damage is normally recovered at the rate of 1 point per ability score per day.)

If an ability score would be damaged below 0, all additional damage is redirected to Con. If Con ever reaches 0, the character dies. (0 Str / 0 Dex result in a character who is only capable of whispering and crawling. 0 Int / 0 Wis result in unconsciousness or a fevered delirium. 0 Cha results in the death of the soul.)

Diseases also have non-numeric effects, which are suffered as long as the character is infected.

### Recovering from Disease Naturally

If you succeed on two of these Con checks in a row, the disease is cured.

If you spent the entire previous day resting in bed, you get +2 on your morning Con check against the disease.

If you were also attended to by healers who used appropriate medicines, you get an additional +2 on your morning Con check. (This requires either an infirmary, or dubious herbs and an appropriate skill check.)

### Recovering from Disease via Exorcism

Casting *protection against evil *on a person gives them a new save against all ongoing diseases, with no penalty for failure.

If *protection against evil *is cast as part of an exorcism (and all priests and clerics know how to perform an exorcism), the save is made at a +2bonus. An exorcism ceremony takes an hour and requires an assistant. Using a vial of holy water (or its equivalent) confers another +2 bonus. If the Con check vs disease is a critical failure, all participants are exposed to the disease.

*Remove curse *instantly cures a disease, but is not a spell that players will ever be able to cast reliably.

### Recovering from Disease via Appeasement

Appeasing a disease spirit is very similar to paying a ransom.

The further the disease has progressed, the higher the ransom will be. Disease spirits are not inexperienced negotiators.

Each disease spirit is appeased by two different things. Roll 2d6 on the Appeasement Method Table to see what they are. If both dice show the same number, then the disease spirit is only appeased by that one thing. If the disease spirit receives that appeasement, it departs.

No actual amounts are listed for the appeasements, since the required offering depends on (a) how desperate the party is, and (b) how much they have to give. Disease spirits base their requirements on their evaluations of you.  For example, if you are dressed like rich nobles, then it will expect more money to be offered than if you were dressed like beggars (just like a regular ransom.)

And yes, clever players can sometimes use this to their advantage.

It is not obvious what methods will appease a particular disease spirit. A cleric can *commune *with the disease spirit and ask it a certain number of yes/no questions in order to ascertain what ransoms it will accept, and how much it expects. And of course, *speak with spirit *will allow you to speak with the disease spirit directly.

Alternatively, you could just try all six methods.

All appeasements must be accompanied by ceremony. This can be as simple as a few respectful words encoded in a prayer to the disease spirit, or simply ritualized begging over the afflicted person.

The appeasements listed below are general; feel free to make them more specific to particular diseases. For example, appeasing a bog pox spirit with money might involve throwing it into the swamp, while appeasing a leprosy spirit with money might involve binding a gold coin into a bubo. A sleeping sickness spirit might require you to put the money under the afflicted person's bed, where it vanishes as soon as it is unobserved.

#### Appeasement Method [d6, roll twice]

1            Blood            A worthy sacrifice.  Perhaps just a chicken if the disease is still 
in its early stages.  Terminal diseases require the sacrifice of a cow (100c) or a person.

2          Epidemic        You must consciously infect other people with your horrible disease.  
Perhaps just one other person if the disease is still in its early stages.  If the disease is 
terminal, a dozen is customary.

3            Flattery         Everyone must gather around and speak loudly about how great the 
disease spirit is, how powerful, and how generous.  Two successful Cha checks are required if the 
disease is in its  early stages, while as many as ten might be required if the disease is terminal. 
 Retries are only possible if the group of flatterers is at least twice as big as last time.  
Certain grandiose gestures (proposing to marry the disease spirit, offering it a knighthood) count 
as one or more automatic successes, but be aware that the disease spirit might actually accept 
these things (2-in-6 chance by default.)

4              Food           The salted herring and hardtack that passes for adventuring “rations” 
doesn't count.  Real food purchased from a real chef, or at least prepared with a skill check and a 
kitchen full of ingredients.  (Kitchens in dungeons are now relevant!)

5        Intoxicants     Perhaps just a bottle of whisky if the disease is still in its early 
stages.  If the disease is terminal, a box of opium (200c) is customary.

6            Money          Gold, silver, jewels, and items of exquisite craftsmanship of magical 
puissance.

- Remember that disease spirits are full NPCs. If the players start talking to them, you may want to roll up a random personality for them. And although they are intelligent, they lack a full understanding of human culture, and can be tricked. They might mistake a carved log for a human if it is wearing clothing, or they might not understand that a character is not actually a king, and has no standing to award knighthoods. You might even be able to fake a character's death well enough that the disease spirit will depart.

Please relay this information to players when they first contract a disease, so they can make informed decisions. Disease mechanics are an open system, not a hidden one.

What features are absent?Impact: http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2017/10/impact.html

The Referee has environments and situations, not a pre-planned “story” of any kind
Players drive things forward with their choices
The game is dangerous. The Referee is not there to kill your characters, but neither is he there to protect them. Dice are rolled out in the open. Death is part of the game. (Luckily, new characters are easy to roll up!)
The situations you encounter are not “balanced.” You might want to avoid encounters, you might want to flee encounters, and if you choose to engage them you’ll want to have the PCs manipulate the fiction toward your advantage (Short hand: Think of conflicts as asymmetrical warfare, not as engaging in a sport.)
In this kind of play the Referee presents the players with an environment that is as solid as possible, that would continue existing if you weren’t there.



# Principia Apocrypha

Honor the dice and the players. Divest yourself of their fate.
Build responsive situations. Leave preparation flexible.

Uphold logic. Let them go off the rails. Make them think

Player ingenuity over characterability. Cleverness rewarded, not thwarted. Ask them how they do it. 

Let them manipulate the world. Make tools unique. Don’t mind the fourth wall

Challenge them. Offer tough choices. Build challenges with  multiple answers and challenges with no answer. Subvert their expectations.

Instill fear, deal death. Deadly but avoidable combat. Keep up the pressure. Telegraph deadliness, but let the dice kill them.

Fill their senses

Reveal the world. Give them layers to peel back.. Bring the world to life. See your world as real. Make your details matter

# 30 Principles of Adventure Design

**Bryce Lynch, summary by Jon Miller**

#### I.General Tips: The 5 C’s

1. **Color**: The referee should give brief but evocative descriptions of locations, monsters, NPCs, and treasures. Avoid the vague or generic.
2. **Context**: In order for their actions to be significant and purposeful, players must generally have some information about the likely consequences of their actions, such as likely reactions of monsters or NPCs.
3. **Choices**: There should be more than one course of action available to players in order for the adventure to continue. Avoid choke points—both literal choke points in the physical layouts of dungeons and other locations, and figurative choke points which require a unique decision or solution in order for the adventure to proceed.
4. **Consequences**: Player actions should be allowed to make a real difference in the adventure and in the campaign. Avoid a set storyline or sequence of events immune to player interference.

5. **Creativity**:Related to (3) and (4), reward player creativity by allowing them to pursue unanticipated courses of action or to produce unanticipated consequences,rather than restricting player action and player creativity by setting up arbitrary constraints in the location layout or course of events.

#### II. Hooks

6. Don’t rely on a single hook; use multiple kinds [(treasure; reward; magic; glory; politicalpower).]()[[1\]](#_msocom_1) 

7. Create a rumor table with hooks and color.
8. Hooks should appeal to the players (not just their characters).
9. Hooks can and should be made complex / nuanced; e.g., working for an evil NPC, or working for rival factions.
10. To support sandbox play, particular dungeon, town, and wilderness locations, monsters, and NPCs should all have hooks.

#### III. Locations

11. Location descriptions should be terse (not verbose) but evocative(not boring, obvious, generic).

12. Only include background info that affects gameplay. Avoid long descriptions of irrelevant info.


13. Rooms should have features that players can interact with to produce meaningful consequences. Give concrete descriptions of secret doors,traps, etc.


14. Floor plan tips:

a.   Multiple routes (vs. choke points or linear, one-way paths).

b.   Multiple entrances / exits.

c.    Multiple stairs per floor.

d.   Open spaces with balconies,galleries, and ledges at various elevations.

e.   Pools and rivers that connect different rooms or levels.

f.    Bridges and ladders.

#### IV. Monsters and NPCs

15. Create interesting, believable motivations for monsters and NPCs.

16. Create factions of monsters and NPCs (which lead to a dynamic,interconnected strategic situation).


17. Give players the choice of allying, attacking, or having other relationships with monsters and NPCs.
18. Create schedules, routines, tactics, and orders of battle for monsters and NPCs.
19. Wandering monsters too should be given motives, goals, hooks, and tactics.
20. Avoid standard monsters. Failing that, describe standard monsters in a non-standard way (e.g., don’t just name their species).
21. Give evocative descriptions of monsters. Give concrete descriptions of their appearance and activities. Go for the telltale sensory detail, rather than the generic abstract trait. Show, don’t tell. Example: Instead of stating that “One of the guards in the camp is a cruel bully,” say that “The burly Manfred takes a leak on poor Tobias’s bedroll, and then he snatches Tobias's roasted chicken dinner from his hand and quickly gobbles it down.”
22. Use truly evil monsters to evoke a Sense of Terror.

#### V. Treasure

23. Treasure should be valuable enough to motivate players and to make the challenges worthwhile.
24. Non-magical treasure should relate to the setting and give clues or information about monsters, NPCs, locations, etc.
25. Avoid standard magic items.
26. Give evocative descriptions of magic items. Give concrete descriptions of their appearance and how they must be manipulated to produce their magical effects.
27. Use magic items to evoke a Sense of Wonder.

#### VI.Format and Functionality

28. Include the following kinds of references:

a.    Rumor / hook table.

b.    Monster / NPC table which lists their main traits, motivations, location, etc.

c.     Room / building table which lists the rooms in a dungeon (or other keyed locations).

29. In published modules, put maps and monster stats on separate sheets(so they are easy to refer to in play).

30. On maps, use keyed symbols to indicate standard features (e.g., lit / unlit, locked / unlocked, secret, trapped, etc.), rather than a verbal description in the location key.


# Coins and Scrolls

## To Roll or Not To Roll

Only roll or call for a roll if both failure and success areinteresting. If failure is inevitable because of the fiction, don't roll. A PCcan't test Strength to flap your arms and fly to the moon. They can't testDexterity to dodge the ground after a 300' fall.

 

If failure is boring, don't roll. If the PCs fail to pick a simplemundane lock, and they have all the time in the world, they'll just keeprolling until they succeed. Just let them open it. If the PCs not spottingsomething means they'll never see it, just tell them what they see. No rollsrequired.

 

Failed rolls have consequences. The most obvious one is time. Afailed roll means wasted time, and wasted time means more opportunity for badthings to happen to the PCs. Merely failing a roll in combat shouldn't bepenalized beyond a wasted attack,but a critical failure (an unmodified roll of 20) might result in additional consequences.

 

Roll sparingly. Because Stats are randomly generated and assigned,it is possible that two PCs in the same party will have vastly differentchances of performing the same task. Minimize this by using Attack and Save(which are the same for most PCs at the same Level), automatic failures, andautomatic successes.


From a player's point of view, a roll is a risk. Testing Strength toleap across a chasm is risky. Putting a ladder across a chasm and carefullyclimbing across does not require a roll. Fighting an orc in melee is a risk.Avoiding the fight entirely might not require a roll.# Inventory Cards

Items are written on blank business cards or index cards. 3 are readied (in hand or belt.) Stack the ones you are not using. This stack is your backpack.

To get an item from the backpack while in combat, roll a d20 and subtract 2 from your roll (minimum result of 1.)You can take any item at or below the result.

Advantages:  Inventory tangibility, quick backpack sorting, and easy passing of items (with notes written on them.)## Light Source Checks

Torch: D8	Candle: D10 			Lantern: D20

Each turn, roll. If the result is less than four, use a lower die. 

If anything less than a four is rolled on a D4, the light source is depleted. 

Use these steps: D20 -> D12 ->D10 -> D8 -> D6 -> D4 -> depleted.## Light Sources

**Light Sources **last a length of time **OR** use *Light Checks* (below.)

**Torch**: 20’ bright light, 40' shadows. Burns for 1 hour. 5 per one slot.

**Lantern**: 30’ bright light, 60’ shadows. Burns for 3 hours per bottle of lampoil.

**Candle**: 5’ bright light, 15’ shadows. Burns for 1 hour. 10 per 1 slot.

**Flint and tinder to light**. 1D4 – DEX modifier rounds light.Minimum = 1 round.# Magic Rules

When a wizard's mind expands, it provides more room for understanding nearby spirits. When this happens, whatever spirit the wizard is nearest and capable of understanding (determined by a roll on the caster's school's table) enters their brain. A spirit trapped in a brain that understands it is a spell.

## Identify Items

A caster may spend one round to determine if an item is magical. Spending one hour to Save vs INT will usually learn something more. Very powerful items, unusual items, or cursed items might require library research or laboratory experimentation to identify. 

Cursed items hide their curse. A Caster may realize their knowledge about a cursed item is incomplete.

Potions cannot be identified magically. Small sips provide clues.

## Using magical items

On each use, roll a d6. On a 1,the magic will be gone, drained, or otherwise unusable after it's used one final run time. 

You might think of a way to remove the item which will allow a player to cleverly think of a way to get it back or sacrifice something to keep it.

## Spells

### Spellcasting

#### Casting from Memory

Magic Die (MD) = 1 D6.

[**Dice**]= # Magic Dice (MD) invested. [**sum**]= values rolled.

1. Choose # [dice] to **invest**.

1. **Roll** invested [dice].

1. [Dice] that show **1-3 return** to casting pool.
2. Spells return to their caster after an 8-hour rest.

------



#### Casting from a Scroll or Book

Scroll or page is destroyed and invests one free MD into the spell.  Spells cast this way do not return to their caster. Instead, they search for something to inhabit or a way to manifest themselves. If they can't do this quickly enough, they're expended into the environs as energy and lose their sentience.

#### Consult a Spell

Spell may be expended to allow caster to consult the spell about relevant information instead of regular effect. [sum] = # of turns to allow conversation.

#### Mishaps and Doom

Rolling doubles causes a Mishap. Rolling triples causes a Doom. A character can only ever suffer three Dooms.

### Storing Spells

A caster's **brain** may contain 4 spell slots. Spells remain in a dead caster's brain for one day and may be extracted in a laboratory.

A **spellbook** holds **10** spells.

A **scroll** holds **1** spell, and 3 scrolls fit in 1 Inventory Slot. Acid or fire damage to character = 50% chance to destroy scrolls.

**Any number of spells can be moved** to and from scrolls or spellbooks or wizard's brains in an hour. Spells **cannot be copied**. They are living things, not simply words on a page.

### Researching Spells

https://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/hogwarts-cant-save-you-now/# Market

## Currency

Only one coin is in popular usage. It's made of copper. 100 of them use one slot. 1000 of them fit in a coin purse, which uses one slot.

## Hirelings

Retainers will not take dangerous risks without an equal share of the loot. They will usually refuse to do much more than carry loot and hold a torch.

### Hiring

| **2d6** | **Hiring Reaction** |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| 12      | Refuse, insulted*   |
| 9-11    | Refuse              |
| 6-8     | Roll again          |
| 3-5     | Accept              |
| 2       | Accept, impressed** |

*Insulted: Reactions of other potential retainers in area penalized by 1. **Retainer's morale gets +1 bonus.

### Morale

Morale = 2D6 under Morale. Success = hold ground. Failure = flee or surrender.

### Default Retainer

HD1 ATK 10 DEF 10
Move 12 Morale 8
SAVE 5 ATR 10 All
Random [profession](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/06/osr-1d100-actually-medieval-professions.html?m=1) + associated gear and weapon.

> Mule slots = 20.

> Cart Slots = 40.



# Weapons

Check for breakage if ATK roll or DEF roll = natural 1 or natural 20.

**Fragile** weapons always break.
**Standard** weapons = 3-in-6 chance on d6. All weapons are Standard unless specified otherwise.
**Masterwork** weapons= 1-in-6 chance on d6. First break = -1 to ATK. Second break = useless.

**Repairs** require an appropriate craftsman and cost 10% of the item’s price per Notch repaired.

Critical hits allow stunts in addition to hit or add second damage roll to attack.

| **Melee Weapons**                                     | **Damage**           | **Cost** | **Inventory Slot** | **Town Availability** |

**Heavy weapons** 1D10 + STR MOD DMG, two hands. Not usable in confined spaces. 2 Slots.

**Slings** = 1D6 DMG. -1 ATK for every 20' beyond the first 20'. Share Slot with up to 3 stones. Stones can always be gathered with a few minutes.

**Bows** 1D6 DMG. -1 ATK for every 30' beyond the first 30'.

**Crossbows** 1D10 DMG. -1 ATK for every 40' beyond the first 40'. Reload costs one full round.

**Arrows** are sold in bundles of 20 and a bundle fits in one Slot. Use a descending dice check starting at D20. Each turn an arrow is used, roll. If the result is less than four, replace the current die with a lower die. If anything less than a four is rolled on a D4 is rolled, the arrows are depleted. (This accounts for recovering arrows after a battle.) D20 -> D12 ->D10 -> D8 -> D6 -> D4 -> depleted.

**Armor break** = -1 to DEF per break. Useless when penalty equals the bonus.

**Repairs** require an appropriate craftsman and cost 10% of the item’s price per Notch repaired.

> **Armor** uses # slots = to its DEF MOD.

**Sunder** a shield to reduce incoming physical DMG (after it's rolled) by 1D12 and leave the shield beyond repair.

### Armor Inventory Slots

One worn piece of armor uses a number of inventory slots equal to the amount of defense points that the armor grants beyond 2. For example, plate armor (+5) uses 3 inventory slots because it grants +5 Defense. Leather armor (+1) worn with a +1 defense helmet uses a total of 0 inventory slots because the total defense is only +2.

### Shields

A shield functions exactly the same way armor does except that it requires one hand to use it and it may be **sundered** (after damage has been rolled) to reduce incoming physical damage by 1d12. After this, it is not repairable.

# Adventuring Gear Liquor, Flask

Just a bunch of booze. Can be thrown like a flask of oil, except for half as long. Good for rousing people and making friends. If you drink it, you get drunk.

> Rules for getting drunk: your critical failure range increases by 1 for every point of Drunk.

# Bottle, Glass

Glass bottles are entirely anachronistic in a psuedomedieval setting! But they're more interesting than goat bladders, because they break.

> Rules for breakage: glass bottles and vials each have a 50% chance of breaking when you take fall damage. Roll for each item separately.

# Caltrops, Bag

 

If you're distracted (by a chase, for example), you need to succeed on a Wis check to notice caltrops. You can spend a round walking through them safely or attempt to jump/dodge them with a Movement check. Running through them unawares will automatically fuck up your feet. Fucked up feet cause you to move at half speed for the rest of the day.

# Crowbar

 Turns most doors from a question to "can we open this door?" to "how long will it take us to open this door?"

# Grease, Sack

 

Dex check to avoid slipping, losing grip. Also can give you a bonus to squeeze through stuff, or escape grapples. Made from living stuff, so it can be affected by any necromancy that can affect cows (or sheep, in some places).

# Holy Symbol (Glove Embossed with The Nine Eyes Against Chaos)

 

Used by clerics. A leather glove with nine eyes in the palm, embossed and painted.

 

# Holy Water

 

2d6 damage to undead. If drank, has a 2-in-6 chance to cure a curse. The only fuel that holy fire can use is [holy fire](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2013/06/fire-fire-and-slime.html).

# Ink, vial (Atrament)

 

Atrament is made from burnt ivory (at least in this setting). Because it was once part of a living creature, it can be affected by any necromancy that can affect stags (or elephants, in some places).

# Lanterns

 

Hooded: 30' radius. Bullseye: 60' cone. If a bullseye lantern is your only light source, combat is difficult (-2 to hit). If dropped or thrown, they spill.

# Lockpicks

 

Break on a critical failure. Critical success means you can do all sorts of shit with the lock: extract it, trap it, rekey it, etc.

# Mirror, Copper

Good for seeing around corners, and entirely anachronistic. Don't worry about it. But if you want to use a mirror to petrify a medusa, you'll need a higher quality mirror than this little dinky shit.

# Mirror, Glass

 

Yes, you can petrify a medusa with this one. Not available in stores, since the means to its manufacture have been lost. Ask the king if he has one, or the elves.

# Oil, Flask

 

In a lantern, burns for 2 hours. As a molotov cocktail, burns for 1d4 damage, 4 rounds, 5' diameter puddle. Alternatively, a line of fire across a 10' hallway. Jumping over fire requires a Movement check, and in the case of animals and goblins, a Morale check.

Oil is made from leviathans (sea monsters, basically). Reduce the price by 50% if you are in a seaside town.

# Rations

 

Try to keep track of what rations are made from--meats are potentially necromantically active. (And yes, a bunch of reanimated strips of salted fish can make a great distraction.)

# Rope, Hemp

 

Holds 1 person and their gear safely (~200 lbs). Start making X-in-6 checks if the rope is put under heavier loads, impacts, or shearing (such as sawing it back and forth along a jagged lip).

> I've played around with making some items weigh more when wet, such as rope. I thought of this brilliant idea when I had to carry wet rope for 6 miles. I don't know how much fun such a rule would be in play, but you know me: I like the idea of keeping simple hazards hazardous. Water, darkness, climbs. Water might be significant enough as it is (since it extinguishes most light sources), and may not need any extra rules.

# Rope, Silk

 

Holds 3 people and their gear safely (~600 lbs). Much stronger than hemp rope.

 

# Salt, bag

 

2d6 damage if dumped on an ooze. Can also be used to salt meat, turning it into rations.

 

> Unsalted meat becomes inedible after 1 day.

 

# Soap

 

Functions like grease except that it can get you cleaner instead of dirtier. Necromantic potential: cow.

# Spellbook

Holds 10 spells. Built to resist water and fire, thank Heaven.

 

# Torch

 

Lasts 2 hours. If you drop them, they continue to burn.

 

> If the party is fighting intelligent foes with darkvision, be sure to have them attack the light sources, especially if there's only one.  Orcs will happily use a combat maneuver to snatch a torch out of your hand and fling it 50' down the hallway.

# Alchemical Items Acid, vial

Can be used to melt a lock, a metal bar, or an 4" hole in the floor, down to the level below. With 10 vials of acid, you can melt a hole down the next dungeon level large enough to squeeze through. On a creature, it does 1d6 damage per round for 3 rounds, or until washed off.

Aqua regia is mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acid. It's orange. (Note: if you haven't had a chance to play with acids as part of your DM education, I suggest that you do. Hydrochloric acid is nasty stuff--you can't even hold a small beaker of 12M at arm's length without it fucking with your eyes and respiration.)

# Antidote, greater (Carbuncle)

 

A carbuncle is a smooth, green stone from the forehead of a creature that is also called a carbuncle. The animal looks a bit like a soft-shelled armadillo famed for its capacity to will itself to die, spoiling its precious carbuncle stone in the process.

If swallowed, a carbuncle instantly cures any poison.

 

# Antidote, lesser (Bezoar)

 

A rough stone harvested from the stomach of a nine-year-old goat that has been been a special diet its whole life, primarily consisting of [shellac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac), persimmons, and potash.

If swallowed, a bezoar causes intense stomach pains, instantly curing any poison while simultaneously dropping you to 0 HP and disabling you for a round while the two poisons war within your body.

# Antiplague, vial (Rosewater)

 

Diseases are caused by bad smells and miasmas. The cure, therefore, is a good smell. Breathing through a rosewater-scented handkerchief gives you +4 to save against contracting diseases. If drank, it gives you the same bonus against ongoing diseases.

Any perfume will have the same effect; rosewater is just the cheapest one.

# Black sugar, packet

 

If eaten, everything that is said to you for the next 8 hours will be treated as a*suggestion*.

 

# Bomb (Goblin bombado)

 

The default bomb deals 3d6 damage in a 10' radius, Dex check for half. You can cut the fuse to be any length you desire, up to 10 rounds. A bomb will go off prematurely if it ever takes fire damage directly (100% chance) or if you take fall damage or fire damage while carrying it (2-in- 6 chance). This is just the default bombado--goblins can make a bomb as big as you want.

> Like the name implies, bombados can only be purchased from, and manufactured by, goblins. This is because they are made from large amounts of goblin dung (which are the only true explosives in Centerra, because of [reasons](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2017/06/elven-revolvers.html)). For many goblins, dung is the only tax they are required to pay, and most goblin towns have a munitions factory located in a position of prominence.

# Bomb, stink, vial

 

Made from volatile sulfur compounds and crushed stink bean. When broken open, creates a thin cloud 20' in diameter. Make a Con check each round of exposure. Failure results in you being unable to do anything except stagger around retching. Goblins and creatures without noses are immune. Animals with powerful noses (wolves, etc) automatically fail their Con check.

# Brain Jelly

 

If packed into the skull of a fresh-killed corpse, it will animate and perform simple commands. Lasts 10 minutes if the body is damaged (default) or a full day if the only thing damaged was the brain (e.g. death via strangulation or head trauma). The animate creature is not undead.

# Cigarettes, pack

 

If smoked, gives you +4 to save vs fear and makes you much easier to track. A pack of cigarettes lasts 3 days of dungeoneering (and holds 20 cigarettes).

# Cave stench, vial

 

Smells of rotting meat. Will attract scavengers and predators after 1d6 exploration turns. Any tracking creature that passes through cave stench will have its delicate sinuses wrecked, and will be unable to track for the rest of the day.

# Crystilletto

 

From [Charcorra](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2013/11/charcorra.html). Single-use daggers that break off in a target, dealing 1d6 additional damage to that creature each time it takes a standard action. Lasts until the creature spends a standard action extracting it.

# Dehydrated water, ampule

Creates 100 gallons of water when broken. It pulls the water in from the air in the dungeon, so you may notice some chapped lips in the minutes after its use. Works fine in deserts, but is obviously useless in outer space.

# Dust of dryness, pouch

 

Absorbs 100 gallons of water. If used as a weapon, deals 5d6 damage to a water elemental or 3d6 damage to an ooze.

# Elixir of youth, vial (Azoth, vial)

 

Ages you 1d6+6 years towards the ideal physical age of 21. Regrows lost limbs. Cures mutations. You permanently gain 1 point of Con.

Azoth is the end goal for most alchemists. The Philosopher's Stone is only pursued by young alchemists, who have not lived long enough to fear old age.

# Fairy dust, pouch

 

Harvested from fairies. Allows you to fly (at walking speed) as long as you only think about happy things. If you want to think about happy things while bad things are happening, you need to make a Charisma check. It is impossible to think about happy things while taking damage. Lasts 10 minutes.

# Fireworks

 

Also of goblin manufacture. Most people have never seen fireworks, and the world is full of misinformation regarding them. Engravings and drawings of fireworks always depict them as leaping imps and dancing dragons.

# Gas, Blinding

 

20' radius. Con check vs blindness. If you fail, you get a second Con check after 10 minutes. If you fail that one, you remain blind permanently.

# Gas, rage (Fumes of hell)

 

20' radius. Con check vs rage like a barbarian. (+2 to attack and damage, must attack each turn, no defensive or subtle actions, must pursue fleeing opponents, can attempt to stop raging prematurely 1/round with a 2-in-6 chance of success.)

[Made by bottling the literal fumes of hell, where they emerge from the ground in the Brimstone Waste.](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2014/10/new-biome-brimstone-waste.html)

# Gas, sleep (Olobia vapors)

 

20' radius. Basically just a *sleep* spell.

 

# Gas mask

Protects against dangerous gases and ambient diseases. (Does not protect against injury- associated diseases, such as when a dire rat bites your leg and then breathes on the wound.)

# Goblin hammer

 

It's really just a long-handled hammer, a grenade, and a detonated strapped together. Single use, 3d6 damage. 100% chance of detonating if you take fall damage while carrying it, or if its dropped. (If its in your hands when you fall, you can throw it in a random direction as a free action.)

# Green slime, vial

 

Literally just a tube full of green slime.

 

This is the most illegal thing on this list. Because of the enormous potential for destruction, simply carrying a vial of green slime into a city is sufficient evidence of Attempted Civicide. You will be tortured for a long, long time before you are allowed to die.

DM's Note: Everything in the last paragraph is common knowledge. Always inform your players before they bring horrible bioweapons up from the Underworld.

# Grenade (Goblin grenado)

 

Explodes after 1d2 rounds, dealing 2d6 damage in a 10' radius, Dex check for half. A grenado will go of prematurely if it ever takes fire damage directly (100% chance) or if you take fall damage or fire damage while carrying it (3-in-6 chance).

> Grenados are the best and you should give them to your players whenever possible.



 

# Ingested poison, bitter (Nightshade)

 

Deals 1d6 damage per round for 1 round (successful Con check) or 3 rounds (failed Con check). Bitter taste must be disguised with strong food. Note: human NPCs in the GLOG rarely have more than 3 HD, and so a failed Con check here is basically sufficient to kill any NPC you want.

> Just as explosives are the favored tactic of goblins, so are poisons the favored tactic of halflings. If you want the fancy poisons, they're the ones to talk to.

# Ingested poison, subtle (Orpiment)

 

Orpiment is a type of arsenic sulfide crystal. It looks like an ugly orange-yellow gemstone. It functions like Nightshade (above) but is absolutely undetectable by taste.

# Ingested poison, deadly (King of Poisons)

 

No taste. No save. Manufactured by filling a large jar with toads, scorpions, snakes, and

spiders. After a day, the jar is opened and the surviving animal christened 'the king of poisons'. It is fed pieces of the other animals before being dried out and ground up.

# Insect repellant (Bog myrtle).

 

Makes you easier to track.

 

# Jeklogen, vial

 

Turns you into your anti-self. Invert all stats (e.g. 13 becomes 7) and invert all of your character's traits. Boys become girls, black hair becomes white. They know everything that the previous character knew. Lasts 2 hours.

The new character is still under control the same player, but has the inverse goals. . . sort of. They know that they won't exist unless the first character drinks more jeklogen, so they have a very good motive to behave. (Bottom line: you aren't required to act against your own interests if your character drinks Jeklogen). Nearly all of them resent this limitation intensely.

# Liquid light, ampule

 

When exposed to air or water, it shines as bright as a torch for 10 minutes. If splashed on a creature that is damaged by sunlight, deals 2d6 damage to them. If splashed on a creature with darkvision, they get -4 to hit until they can wipe it off (standard action).

# Midnight wind, ampule

 

Also known as vapors of night. When broken, all fires within 10' are extinguished. Fires larger than a campfire may survive (X-in-6 chance, determined by the DM).

# Mithridatium, vial

 

Gives you a permanent +2 vs Poisons. Stacks.

 

# Mondmilch, vial

 

If drank, you will believe everything you hear for the next 30 seconds, and you will forget any conflicting memories. If people tell you conflicting information during these 30 seconds, you will go mad.

DM's Note: get out a stopwatch and make the players do this in real time.

 

# Mutagen, vial

 

Gain a random mutation. If fed to a small animal (dog-sized or smaller) it grows into a mutant, humanoid version of that creature with Int 3d4.

# Obliviax, packet

If this powder is eaten, total amnesia is the result. If the powder is blown into someone's face, they forget the last minute.

# Ooze, vial

 

This is just a baby ooze with 1 HP. If you feed it a cow, you'll have a full size ooze on your hands in about 2 hours. If you throw it on someone, it will deal 1d4 acid damage each round until it is scraped off. Available in all the varieties of ooze.

# Philosopher's Stone

 

A nondescript grey stone. Anything it touches turns into gold. There is no limit on this, so if you give it to your players, expect to have your whole campaign turned upside down.

If the philosopher's stone is ever broken, a thing like a small purple slug will emerge from the geode-like interior and fly away. All the gold that it created will revert to its original substance.

# Philosopher's Frost

 

Looks like a chunk of ice. If it touches water, or a water-containing substance, it will freeze it. Additionally, any water that comes into contact with materials frozen by the philosopher's frost will also be frozen. (See also: [ice-nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat%27s_Cradle).) If it ever spreads to the water table, rivers, or oceans, all of the world's water will freeze.

If the original piece of philosopher's frost is ever shattered, all of the alchemically-frozen water will revert to normal. Creatures killed by it will revive without any ill effect except a phobia of the cold and nightmares of winter.

# Poisoned Arrow, Sleep (Olobia Paste)

 

Con vs *sleep*. Multiple arrows in a single turn still result in a single Con check vs sleep, but each arrow beyond the first gives a -1 penalty.

> For the price of three arrows, you can poison a melee weapon.

 

# Poisoned Arrow, Slow (Black Hellebore)

 

Takes 1 minute to take effect. Con vs poison. 1d6 damage per round for 1 round (on a successful save) or 3 rounds (on a failed save).

# Poisoned Arrow, Weak (Viper Venom)

 

Takes effect immediately. Con vs poison. 1d4 damage per round for 1 round (on a successful save) or 3 rounds (on a failed save).

# Poisoned Arrow, Weak (Red Devil Frog Slime)

 

Slime harvested from the skin of the red devil frog. Takes effect immediately. Con vs poison. 1d6 damage per round for 1 round (on a successful save) or 3 rounds (on a failed save).

# Rust powder, pouch (Metal rot, powder)

 

Functions exactly as the touch of a rust monster. Enough to turn a suit of armor into so much garbage. The powder looks like gritty black mold. Single-use.

Metal rot is actually a disease that rots metal. It is common in water, which is why water causes rust. It is killed by exposure to air.

# Shrieker sprout

 

A cute little shrieker mushroom, about the size of a penis. Shrieks whenever there is movement near within 10'. Sold with each of its 'mouths' pre-gagged, so it won't be screaming the whole time you're carrying it in your backpack.

# Smoke bomb

 

Creates a cloud of thick smoke 20' in diameter. Great for escaping, since pursuers cannot see which way you went, and will choose randomly from the possible directions that they know about.

# Sovereign glue, vial

 

Can join any two objects together. Can repair broken weapons and armor. Can attach a severed limb to a stump (fresh stump, old stump, your arm, someone else's arm, doesn't matter). If poured in a wizard's ear, the wizard can [fuse spells](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/05/mutant-spells.html). If two people make out with it in their mouths, they'll [fuse](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2015/07/character-fusion.html).

Sovereign glue is greatly desired by all alchemists. It's an essential precursor in the production of a philosopher's stone or azoth.

# Spiders, bag

 

Exactly what it says on the tin. 1 point of damage on a direct hit, but will distract anyone nearby who is freaked out by thousands of spiders crawling everywhere.

# Stim jelly (Talekeshi jelly)

 

A shitty health potion used by junkies and atheists. You regain 1d4 HP and take 1d4 Con damage. Fairly easy to find in slums. Administered by rubbing it into the gums. Chronic usage causes psychosis. Made from the brains of abused cattle.

# Truth Serum

 

Smells like rubber cement. You'll have to force it down their throat. Used for interrogation, but mostly just causes mad babbling. Lasts 30 minutes, then the person falls unconscious for 12 hours. Assuming the PCs are using this to interrogate people, roll a d4 every 10 minutes.

1 - mad rantings, useless.

2 - they respond to your questions, but they don't address your questions directly.

3 - they don't respond to your questions, but some things they say are potentially useful.

4 - they babble in response to your questions. There is useful information hidden among the chaff.

# Alicorn powder, pouch

 

Cures all diseases, poisons, and restores all lost HP. Thereafter, you suffer the curse of the unicorn, and all critical successes you roll are inverted into critical failures.

# Universal solvent, vial (Alkahest, vial)

 

Able to separate anything into its prime components. Can purify anything (by separating the poison into an immiscible layer). Can eject a soul from a body (potentially curing demonic possession). If you want to get really 4e with it, you can also use it to separate enchantments from items, and move them onto other items. Can move curses the same way.

In most cases, the element that was separated has now been washed off/vomited/sedimented as a separate material that you can now carry around in the vial, like magical run-off. For example, if you used alkahest to extract a demon, the demon is now a small crystalline man formed for bile salts and denatured alkahest. You can carry him in your pocket. Rehydrating him allows him to escape this form, while eating him allows him to repossess you.

Alkahest is greatly desired by all alchemists. It's an essential precursor in the production of a philosopher's stone or azoth.

# Unwater, skin

 

Destroys dissolved oxygen in water. Water-breathing creatures will begin to suffocate immediately. Harmless if drank. Can affect a potentially large area, about 500' in diameter. Invented to repel [merfolk ](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2015/10/merfolk-and-false-shipwrecks.html)attacks.

# Movement

> **MOVE** = 12 + DEX MOD - ENC.
>
> Party MOVE = lowest MOVE score.

Check MOVE to climb, jump, or flee.

Party movement rate is determined by the speed of the slowest member.

Moving at a fast pace prevents mapping. Characters aren't able to observe their environment as carefully. 

------

## Climbing

> Check **MOVE** to **climb**. 
>
> Add **1 ATR modifier per turn spent studying** the route. If a new segment is visible, do a second MOVE check.

Each exploration turn spent studying the climbing route will add one Attribute modifier from the player character's sheet to their MOVE.

Roll under the character's (adjusted) MOVE. 

If the roll fails, the referee should roll a D10 to see what percent is climbed before the fall.

------

A character with a MOVE of 12 and a Wisdom modifier of +2 could spend one turn to study the route. When they add their Wisdom modifier, the player will attempt to roll under 14 instead of under 12 to successfully complete the climb. 

## Dungeon Exploration

> **Exploration** = MOVE*10'.

A square on a dungeon map is usually 10'x10'. 

However, the referee (or a published adventure) may choose other measurements.

------

## Encounters, Movement in

> **Combat Round** = MOVE*10'÷3.

## Falling

> **1D6 damage per 10' fallen beyond first 10'**. 
> **Hanging** from a ledge **reduces** distance by **10**'. 
> **Intentional** falls result in a **DEX check** to **reduce** the calculated distance by **10'**.
> **50% chance of fragile items breaking**.

Every 10 feet fallen beyond the first 10 feet incurs 1d6 damage to the character. Hanging from a ledge reduces the calculated fall distance by 10 feet. Intentionally falling causes a Dexterity check; success reduces the calculated fall distance by 10 feet.

When the calculated fall distance is greater than 10 feet, there is a 50% chance of fragile items breaking, unless they are held in hand. Roll a D6 for each stored, fragile item. On a result of 1-3, the item will break.

## Swimming

> **Swim** = MOVE÷3’ per turn. Not possible in armor heavier than leather.Use one of the following:

* [The Metamorphica](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/115703/The-Metamorphica-Classic-Edition)
* [1d500 Biological Mutations](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html) and [1d500 Supernatural Mutations](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/04/osr-1d500-supernatural-mutations.html)

## Overland actions

1d4 exploding turns to find the source of tracks.
Roll under half Wisdom in order to Hunt, Forage, or gather Herbs. 

Hunting requires to rolls of an arrow usage die and results in 1d4 rations.
**Foraging**
Gathering herbs finds a single herb.

### Travel

See *Overland Travel* or *Overland Travel, Traditional*.

### Forage

A party may forage when in a wilderness environment. (Doing this requires every party member's turn.) It does not take extra time or slow travel, but it may only be done once per 6 miles per day. Roll under half the Wisdom of one party member to  gain the party enough food for d6 meals (a meal is only half of a ration.)

### Hunt

A party may hunt when in a wilderness environment. It requires one hour and causes two encounter checks. Roll under half of a party member's Wisdom and spend 2 arrows.

A character may attempt to roll under half of their wisdom in order to Hunt, Forage, or find Herbs. Hunting costs 1d4 arrows and gives 1d4 rations. Foraging gives 1d3 rations. Herbalism gives a single beneficial herb which can act as medicine.

### Explore

| **Choose one of the below:** | Obvious   | Not Obvious | Hidden           | Well-hidden |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| **D6 result**                | [No Roll] | 1-3         | 1-2              | 1           |
| **MOVE Check**               | [No Roll] | MOVE+WIS-2  | Check MOVE+WIS-5 | MOVE+WiS-9  |

Obvious features are discovered upon moving into a hex.

To explore the hex the characters are in, spend the same number of hours it would cost to move into the current hex (consult the Overland Travel Chart.) Then roll 1d6 to determine if unnoticed features of interest are discovered. (Give a bonus to this roll equal to the Wisdom modifier of a party member who has knowledge of this kind of terrain.)

> Alternate system to allow players to roll and to allow player wisdom to alter the outcome
> To navigate without getting lost:
> Plain = Check MOVE + [WIS+7] 
> Mountain, Hill, Forest = Check MOVE + [WIS-5]
> Desert, Jungle, Swamp = Check MOVE + [WIS-2]## Daylight

Traveling at night is nearly impossible without a road. (You might choose to make an exception for a full moon.) 

When night travel occurs, increase the probability of a random encounter by one die face at night. (This usually means a 2 in 6 chance of an encounter.)

Winter - 8 hours of light
Spring/Fall - 11 hours of light
Summer - 14 hours of light

## Encounter Checks In the Wilderness

Encounters are checked once when the party is sleeping, once per hex moved through (or once per 6 miles), and whenever the party is loud.

The chance of encounters depends on the terrain being explored. By default, use the following probabilities, with higher rolls resulting in encounters:
City, clear, grasslands, settled lands: 1-in-6.
Barren, desert, forest, hills, ocean, river: 2-in-6.
Jungle, mountains, swamp: 3-in-6.

## Hex Travel

The standard hex size is 6x6 miles wide.

For the sake of simplicity, assume the party is at the center of the hex they begin in and that their destination is at the center of the hex they stop traveling in.

However, the referee (or a published adventure) may choose other measurements.

------

When moving from one 6-mile hex into another one, the total distance travelled is 6 miles. 

When moving all the way across one hex and ending in a new hex adjacent to it, the distance travelled is 9 miles.

## Overland Sight

Characters can usually see for three miles around them, in open terrain. 

This range may sometimes be reduced (e.g. in overgrown terrain such as a forest) or increased (e.g. looking out from the top of a mountain.)# Overland Travel

## Navigation (and Getting Lost)

To navigate accurately (without getting lost,) check MOVE with the following changes:

Plain = Check [MOVE+WIS MOD]+7 
Mountain, Hill, Forest = Check [MOVE+WIS MOD]-5
Desert, Jungle, Swamp = Check [MOVE+WIS MOD]-2

Keeping a large landmark in sight can improve or ensure the chances of accurate navigation, according to the referee's decision.

When lost, the party randomly moves to a different hex adjacent to the one intended.

------

> Alternately, the GM can roll 1d6 and consult the Overland Travel Chart to determine whether the party becomes lost. This allows the referee to avoid telling the players that they went the wrong way allowing nothing more than a description the environment they find themselves moving through.
>
> 
>
> To stay on-track, roll 1d6
>
> Road: never
>
> Plain: 1-5
>
> Mountain, Hill, Forest: 1-2
>
> Desert, Jungle, Swamp: 1-3

## Overland Travel Chart

When traveling across plains a character may travel as many miles as their movement score in a day, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 6, without gaining FATIGUE. (This is because a hex is typically 6 miles wide. A party cannot partially enter a hex.)

| Party MOVEMENT | Miles per day without FATIGUE | Hexes per day without FATIGUE | Hours per hex |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1-5            | 0                             | 0                             | Cannot travel |
| 6-11           | 6                             | 1                             | 12            |
| 12-17          | 12                            | 2                             | 6             |
| 18-23          | 18                            | 3                             | 4             |
| 24-35          | 24                            | 4                             | 3             |
| 36-71          | 36                            | 6                             | 2             |
| 72             | 72                            | 12                            | 1             |

------

The average party member has a movement of 12. If the slowest party member has a movement of 12, the party may explore 6 miles in 6 hours.

## Terrain

> **Plains = no change**
> **Road** = -2 hours (min of 1 hour.)
> **Hills** = +1 hour.
> **Forest and Desert** = +2 hours.
> **Jungle and Swamp**  = +3 hours.
> **Mountain**  = +4 hours.

| **Terrain** | **Hours**              |

When traveling outdoors, away from a settlement, consult the Traditional Overland Travel Chart to determine the number of hours it will take, based on the slowest party member's movement rate.

Traveling more than 12 hours adds 1 fatigue per hour. See *Conditions*.# Procedure of Play

## Time Definitions

> 1 Haven turn = 4 weeks. 
> 1 Standard turn = about 10 minutes.
> 1 Combat Round = about 6 seconds. 

6 Seconds = 1 Combat Round
10 Combat Rounds = 1 Minute
10 Minutes = 1 Local Turn
6 Local Turns = 1 Hour
24 Hours = 1 Day
7 Days = 1 Week
5 Weeks = 1 Month (35 Days)
10 Months = 1 Year (350 days) 

## Overland Turn

Overland turns are used when traveling over a distance.

1. The referee does maintenance (checks for light sources and other things altered by time.)
2. The party decides where to travel.
3. The referee determines whether the party becomes lost and determines weather, if deemed necessary.
4. The referee checks for wandering monsters or other encounters. 
5. The referee describes terrain and locations as players move through, allowing players to react and describing the results. If an encounter with a possibly hostile creature or person occurs, follow the encounter Procedure.

------

When checking for encounters, you may use a system presented to you in the module you're using, or you may use this simple system:

**Random Travel Encounters (d6)**

| 1       | 2            | 3          | 4       | 5-6     |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------- | ------- |
| Monster | Monster Omen | Non-combat | Mundane | Nothing |

or

http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2015/02/have-nicer-trip.html 

- Hunting.  Slows the party down a lot and costs some ammunition, but might yield a lot food.
- Foraging.  Slows the party down a little, but might yield modest amounts of food.
- Befriending NPCs.  Can raise their morale.  If you talk to an NPC all day and make a successful Charisma check, roll a d12.  If the result is higher than the NPC's current morale, it improves by 1.  Requires a tiny bit of roleplaying.
- Herbalizing.  Slows the party down a little, but might yield valuable medicines and antidotes.
- Just chatting with each other.  Awards a tiny amount of XP, like 10xp per day traveled in dangerous wilderness.  Requires a tiny bit of roleplaying.
- Scouting.  Slows the party down a litte, but gives them a chance to find a defensible/hidden place to spend the night.  Also gives a higher chance of finding hidden locations in the hex.

2. Each PC describes their actions for one turn. (Each turn represents approximately ten minutes.)
3. The referee describes the results. If an encounter with creatures or persons of unknown disposition occurs, follow the encounter Procedure.
4. If the players decide to camp, roll
   1. Conflict

**Guild Professions** (marked with a G) require membership in a guild.

**High-Status Professions** (82-100) earn double Income. You are also treated better, even as an apprentice, than most other professions.

Normally, a player character starts with a Profession as a Skill and with the item listed, but not with the weapon listed.

# Starting items

A party always starts with the basics: a lantern, 3 flasks of oil (which fill one slot.)

Each player character also starts with a backpack (which does not use a slot and grants two extra slots) a blanket (1 slot) a waterskin (1 slot)  1 meal, 2 rations (2 slots) and flint and tinder (0 slots.)

Some classes or professions might also include items.

Match your highest attribute score (the column on the left) with your starting HP to determine what other starting items you have.
