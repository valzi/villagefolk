**Make Something Up**

Make something up. Now it's true. You can only do this once, and it must be done when you gain the template. It can't directly contradict anything that anyone knows and cannot directly benefit a player character. (It can't grant mechanical bonuses, treasure, etc.) You may only use 1d10+4 syllables.







## Thief

Starting Equipment: leather armor, lockpicks, dagger

Starting Skill: see below. You also gain the Locksmith and Pickpocket skills when you take your first Thief template.

A: Always Prepared, the Heist

B: Sharp as a Knife, Lucky

C: Opportunist

D: Very Lucky, Great Escape

You gain +1 Stealth for each Thief template you possess.

**Always Prepared**

In town, you may spend any amount of money to buy an Unlabeled Package. When the package is unwrapped, you declare what it contains, as long as the contents comprise the appropriate number of Inventory Slots, don’t cost more than you originally paid, and are available in town. You can put multiple items inside a large Unlabeled Package, including smaller Unlabeled Packages. You can have no more than two Unlabeled Packages at a time.

**The Heist**

Once per 3 days (or once per adventure or dungeon or campaign arc), you can gain 10% bonus XP for any one valuable item you personally stole. It has to pass through your hands, or you have to be the one masterminding the theft. Unguarded or abandoned treasure does not count (unless there are traps.) For example, a gem worth 1,000gp would give you 100 extra XP. If the bonus XP would cause you to 
gain a Level, you instead gain the exact amount needed to gain the level.

**Lucky**

Once per day you can reroll one of your d20 rolls, or a single Skill test.

**Opportunist**

Whenever you get a situational bonus to an Attack roll (surprise, elevation, etc) you deal an additional +1d6 Damage.

**Very Lucky**

You get an additional use of your Lucky ability once per day. An adjacent ally can use one of your rerolls, provided you could have plausibly assisted them.

**Great Escape**

Once per day, you can automatically escape from something that is restraining you and that you could plausibly escape from. This includes grapples, lynchings, and awkward social situations, but not sealed coffins.

1. You followed your husband or lover to war but returned alone. You picked up a few useful skills along the way and don't intend to return to your former life. Start with a handcart and a second dagger.
2. You were born and raised in a soldier's camp and have never known another life. You fear neither the law nor the Church. Start with 3 wineskins and absolutely shocking language.

Also, roll at least once on [this table](http://elfmaidsandoctopi.blogspot.ca/2016/02/d100-how-i-was-wronged-by-that-villain.html.) You start with a gem worth 1gp.
6. You saw the war as an opportunity to profit. Start with 1 camp follower. No matter your Estate, you can read and write.

**Farmer**

1. Your lord forced you into a life of unjust service, either on his estates or in a War. You were eventually able to escape. You start with 3 extra rations. Roll on [this table](http://elfmaidsandoctopi.blogspot.ca/2016/02/d100-how-i-was-wronged-by-that-villain.html) to accumulate other wrongs and grievances.
2. You stole something so minor and inconsequential it is hardly worth mentioning, save that the guilt haunts you to this day. d6: 1. candle stub, 2. eggs, 3. loaf of bread, 4. flowers, 5. bit of ribbon, 6. cup of beer. You can steal anything and commit any crime provided it does not resemble the object of your guilt. Gain a +2 Save vs Fear, but Save vs Fear with a -4 penalty if confronted with something that resembles your guilt-causing object.
3. You are the [d10+4]th child of a poor farmer. You needed to leave or risk starvation. Expect [terrible letters from home](http://elfmaidsandoctopi.blogspot.ca/2017/02/d100-terrible-letter-from-home.html.) If all your older siblings die you can inherit the farm.
4. You believe you are cursed. One year, your crops withered, your friends turned against you, your cattle melted, and your house burned down. You were expelled from your village. Start with the ability to sense magic (as a wizard.)

**Frontier**

1. You lived in a [lawless border region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Reivers.) Your lord changed every few years. Castles were demolished and rebuilt. Farms were plundered. Start with a horse and a good eye for the weather.
2. The region where you grew up was so poor iron and worked leather were rarities. Start with a complete ignorance of civilization. Anything more complicated than a saddle fascinates you and marks you as a near-savage. Rather than +10% bonus XP for spending money on purely frivolous things, you gain +15%.
3. You belonged to a clan of [wreckers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrecking_(shipwreck)#.22False_lights.22.) Start with the False Light cantrip (see below) and the ability to swim.

5. You were hired by a village to protect them when their lord could not or would not. If you betrayed the village, start with 1gp (in loose coins and trinkets.) If you helped them, start with 1 extra ration and a goat.
6. You lived in the high wilderness, robbing anyone who passed into your territory. Start with a bow, 20 arrows, and a deep-seated fear of druids.

**Unusual**

You gain the skill listed, not the "Unusual" skill (which isn't a real skill anyway.)

1. You were an apprentice to a wizard, but he considered you talentless and cast you out. Start with 1 random cantrip from a random wizard school and the "Literature" skill. You can read and write.


1. A divine vision commanded you to abandon your past life and roam the world. There is a 1-in-10 chance this divine vision was actually true. Otherwise, it was caused by poor diet, evil spirits, or your own overactive imagination. Roll on the [Table of Professions](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-1d100-actually-medieval-professions.html) and gain the skill and item listed.


1. The life of an outlaw attracted you for unusual reasons. Start with the "Poet" skill. You can read and write.


1. You were struck by lightning once and survived. Gain a +2 bonus to Charisma when interacting with [water or lightning elementals](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/03/osr-what-does-elemental-want.html.) You have no idea this bonus exists. You may be struck by lightning again, if circumstances permit it. Roll on the [Table of Professions](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-1d100-actually-medieval-professions.html) and gain the skill and item listed.


1. You committed a terrible crime, but thanks to the intercession of a traveling Paladin, you were exiled instead of being executed. Start with the "Farmer" skill and strong feelings about religion.


1. Theft can never be secure if witnesses remain. Start with the "Poisoner" skill and 3 vials of poison (d6.)

**Cantrip: Wrecker**
You can only learn and cast this cantrip if you were raised in a [wrecker clan](http://www.historic-uk.com/CultureUK/Smugglers-Wreckers/.) It does not require any magic dice or other magical aptitude. You can cast it once per night, and only at night, targeting a lantern or torch. Any sentient creature who sees the light of the lantern, at any distance, must Save or believe it is the light of a ship, safe at harbor. If there is no possible reason for the light to come from a ship (you cast it underground, miles from a river), anyone affected may make a new Save every minute. If a creature does not know what a ship is, the spell provides a helpful but deeply confusing mental image. The cantrip ends at dawn or when the light is extinguished.



##  Goliards

**Gear:** robes, walking stick (as quarterstaff), 3 wineskins full of cheap wine.

A: Provoke, Fortune's Wheel, Dissolute

B: A History of Seduction

C: Heartfelt Sorrow, A Square Meal

D: Friendly Face, Well-Practiced Seduction

****

**Provoke**

You can read people and find their weaknesses and insecurities. As a full round action, target creature who can see, hear, and understand you must Save or be provoked by you. In combat, they will attack you. This ability cannot force an opponent to make major tactical errors or leap off cliffs. Out of combat, they must Save or act in anger (violence, shouting, writing poetry to defame you.)

**Fortune's Wheel**

You are resigned to the whims of fate. Before combat begins, on the first round, before Initiative is rolled, you may roll a number of d20s equal to four times [the number of Goliard templates you have]. (4 at level 1, 16 at level 4.) Write down the numbers that are rolled. You must then arrange them in a fixed order. Any time you would roll a d20 (for Initative, Attacks, Saves, etc.) use the top result from the list instead and cross it off. Once you use up all the results you listed, roll normally.

You can also use this ability in a stressful, multi-check situation such as a chase, a prolonged espionage attempt, etc. Ask the GM.

**Dissolute**

If you ever have more than 50gp on your person and are able to spend it, you must Save or spend it within 24hrs. Save a second time, and if you fail that, half the money you spend is lost and provides no benefit whatsoever. The second Save may not be required if your spending habits are sufficiently profligate already.

**A History of Seduction**

If left alone with a willing, interested, or corruptible person for 1d4 - [the number of Goliard templates you have] hours, to a minimum of 1 hour, you can seduce them. You need to be able to carry on a conversation without anyone overhearing. A soft horizontal surface also helps but is not required. Roll on the Seduction Side Effects table** **(not yet published.) Targets who have taken vows or whose preferences do not match yours get a Save to have second thoughts. Targets are aware you are trying to seduce them and will act accordingly (including throwing you out, kicking you in the face, etc..) PCs are not affected unless they choose to be affected.

**A Square Meal**

Lunch heals you for 1d6 + [Level]x2 HP, rather than 1d6 + [Level], provided you have wine, beer, or liquor to go with your food.

**Heartfelt Sorrow**

If you roll a critical failure, you may reroll the result by dropping to 0 HP. If you were at negative HP, you instead heal to 0 HP.

**Friendly Face**

Whenever you hire or obtain a hireling or follower, you have a 1-in-6 chance of also getting a [Camp Follower](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-table-of-camp-followers.html.) You gain a +4 bonus to rolls made to evaluate hireling quality or obtain hirelings.

**Practiced Seduction**

Select one entry on the Seduction Side Effect table between 21 and 80. If you would roll on the table, there is a 5-in-6 chance that the listed effect occurs instead. You can always choose to roll.

### Mechanical Notes on the Goliard

First, you're a decent fighter. Really! You start with a quarterstaff and you heal quickly. You can also set the order of your rolls in combat (probably putting all the good rolls first and hoping combat doesn't last long enough to get to the bad rolls.) You've got social techniques too. The downside is that you are really good at annoying people. So good, in fact, that you're not likely to gain many benefits from medieval society. 
Second, your social techniques - seduction and provocation - can be used to get all sorts of information, plot hooks, and actions out of people. If you need to handle an impossible social situation, a goliard is the class to do it.

### What Are You Doing Here?

[You are a wandering priest, a traveling entertainer, satirist, and protester.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliard) You live riotously and remarkably free of social conventions and stifling norms. You move through the world seeking education and [adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Palaiologos_Tagaris.) In ordered times you might be suppressed, banned, or excommunicated, but these are disordered times, and you can flourish. Unlike troubadours, you don't sing of courtly love and chivalry ideals. You sing about sex, wine, and rock and roll.

This class has no gender restrictions. If you are female, you *might *need to put on a beard if you're going to argue with the Bishop, but out in the world nobody really cares. The world is too disordered to investigate the affairs of the goliards and their  too closely. You could also be a roving or disgraced nun. If you're sick of the restrictions of medieval characters, this is the class for you. Conventions - from dress to sexuality to piety - are tossed out the window.

You are a member of the [First Estate](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-three-estates.html.).. in theory. You are also an [Outlaw](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-three-estates.html.) You osculate between these two modes of life regularly. You start as a Deacon or an Initiate. You can read and write.

**Starting Skill: **1. Music, 2. Literature, 3. Religon

**Music**

1. Start with a cheap musical instrument (a lute, a pipe, etc.) worth 5sp. You can play it to seduce targets who don't speak your language. 

2. You know hundreds of songs for all occasions. Start with a book of songs, filled with your own notes and rude drawings.
3. You are noted for your volume. Start with a nickname like "the Deep Bell" or "Thunderstorm" and 1d10cp.
4. You believe you are talented; others disagree. Your singing or playing automatically causes the Provoke effect (see above) against any musically inclined targets who can hear you.
5. You have traveled widely. Make up 1d6 ludicrous lies. You gain the "Foreign Parts" skill, but people from Around Here distrust you.
6. You can play any musical instrument provided you are very drunk. Start with a cheap musical instrument (a lute, a pipe, etc.) worth 5sp.

**Literature**

1. You love to read anything you can get your hands on. Start with 2 books. You must Save or read books you find in the dungeon (even if they've got eyeballs on the cover.)

2. You can swear to love someone in 3 languages and just swear in another 10. Your vocabulary is limited but endearing. You can seduce targets who don't speak your language.

3. You have memorized hundreds of poems. You are secretly romantic. Start with a basket of flowers.
4. You read a [very controversial piece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_de_la_Rose) of courtly literature. You either hate it completely and will denounce it at every opportunity, or you will defend it as a work of unrivaled genius and beauty. Either way,  you can make easily find common ground with people who share your view.
5. Start with a forbidden book. Its contents are scandalous. There are illustrations. You won't part with it for love or money.

6. You just robbed someone. Start with 1d10gp (in small change), a goose-down pillow, and a pair of good boots.  

**Religion**
1. Your impressions of authority figures are hilarious (and also felonious.) You can mimic almost anyone's voice and mannerism after a few moments of study.
2. You have memorized the entire liturgy, including variants. You can perform a ceremony for any occasion; weddings, funerals, excommunications, etc.
3. Your conduct in your parish, monastery, or convent was scandalous. Start with a dagger and +2 Save vs Fear.
4. You knocked off a bishop's [mitre ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitre)and stole it. It's worth 2gp.

5. You have a specific weakness. You must Save to resist trying to seduce a category of person (priests, nuns, married men, married women, brunettes, men with beards and sturdy biceps, etc..) Start with a spare set of robes and good boots.
6. You can disguise yourself as a different gender. Start with a second set of robes and a small makeup kit worth 5sp.

| **1d10** | **Targets of Criticism**         | **Options**                              |

## Class: Monk or Nun

Starting Equipment: robes, holy book

Starting Skill: see below

A: Unarmed Strike, Literacy, Restrictions of Your Order

B: Stunning Fist

C: Evasion, Obscure Knowledge

D: Pronouncement, Improved Dodge

**Unarmed Strike**
You are not trained in the use of weapons. Even a cudgel is foreign to you. On a successful Attack roll you deal a maximum of 1 damage. 

If you want to play a warrior-monk, go with a Fighter and start in the First Estate. 

**Literacy**
You can read and write. [A surprising number of people](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/07/osr-medieval-correspondence-part-1-now.html?showComment=1500755925988#c3132873264689852595) could do both in the middle ages, but you can *really write*. Your letters can allow for Charisma tests at a distance. You can roll to see the intentions of an author, the delicate themes of a poem, and the inconsistencies in a complex text. To most people this is a kind of sorcery.

**Restrictions of Your Order**
You do not start trained in the use of any weapons (-4 to Attack until you land 8 successful hits in combat.) You can wear armour, but its encumbrance is doubled for you. You are also expected to avoid the use of magic, from wands to enchantments to spell cast on you for your own protection. In practice, do what you want, but expect angry letters from your Abbot or Abbess if word gets around that you've broken your vows or publicly disgraced your Order. You also have a -2 to Save vs Fear. Make up at least 3 other restrictions or demands.

**Stunning Fist**
If you strike someone (even with a weapon) and they weren't expecting it, you deal normal damage (1+Strength Bonus for a punch, 1d6+Strength Bonus for a dagger, etc.) on the first round of combat. If the target *really* wasn't expecting it, and had total trust in your non-violent ways, they must also Save or be stunned for 1 round.

**Evasion**
You can never be pinned in a corner by difficult theological topics or arguments. You can always retreat to authority, throw up textual obstacles, or deploy dogma. No one can make you admit something in conversation that you did not intend to admit;  any accidental disclosures are retroactively fixed, if possible.

**Obscure Knowledge**
Once per session, you can declare something is to be true because you read it in a book. The base chance of the thing actually being true is 50%. There has to be a plausible way you could know about it from reading books (new discoveries, minor details, and personal secrets are unlikely.) You don't know whether or not it is true right away; the GM will roll when it matters. You might only be partially correct, but you will never be catastrophically wrong. If you declare that bugbears fear albino goats, they will either fear albino goats or be indifferent to albino goats. They won't be driven into a murderous rage by them. If you have access to a library of 50 books, the base chance increases to 80%.

****

**Pronouncement**

You can speak for up to 3 hours without pause on a given topic. No tests required. Peasants, nobles, and other sensible people will hear you out politely, unless they've got something better to do. Monsters will still devour you, dragons might argue with you, and you don't impose a supernatural charm effect on anyone. Still, your audience might take up a cause or change their ways. 

**Improved Dodge**

Once per session, you can declare that an attack that hit you missed instead. You can do this after damage has been rolled but before anything else happened. This won't save you from falling off a cliff or a collapsing cavern, but spells will turn away, sword thrusts will miss, and traps will mysteriously fail.

### Mechanical Notes on the Monk

This class is *astoundingly *weak in combat. It's not a glass cannon, it's a glass thimble. But it also has access to some very powerful and very broad out-of-combat abilities. You can invent truths to save the party, write letters to important people, support a cause, calm or raise a mob, and generally meddle with the course of history. You can also get filthy rich by [several ](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-indulgences-and-clerical-services.html)methods. 

### Who Are You?

You can be either male or female. You are a member of the [First Estate](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-three-estates.html) and you *must *[think like a member of the First Estate.](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/09/thinking-medieval-first-estate.html) You start at the rank of Initiate. You answer to an Abbot or Abbess, and they answer to a Bishop or Archbishop. You don't have to be pious or devout to be a monk or a nun. You don't even need much religious knowledge. However, you are expected to retreat from the world to a life of spiritual labour. Prayer, devotion, instruction, and solitude are your only goals. For some reason you have left your holy retreat, perhaps permanently, and now wander the rest of the world. You are not ordained, and cannot sell [indulgences](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-indulgences-and-clerical-services.html), perform services, hear confession, or preach. You can become ordained (if you are male) without too much difficulty, if you are in the good graces of your overlord the Bishop.

### Starting Skill

1. History, 2. Literature, 3. Medicine, 4. Religion.


  **History**
2. You have read about fallen empires, lost kingdoms, and ancient cultures long extinct. Things were much better in the past. You are able to speak 2 extra languages, but you also have a sense of nostalgia.
3. You keenly understand the recent history of the local area, as your abbey was persecuted by the current rulers' ancestors. Start with a wildly inaccurate map (draw it yourself) and a distrust of the Second Estate.
4. You read a book from Foreign Parts, translated badly, but with many interesting comments. The desire to travel gnaws at you. Start with a leather bag full of dried peas.
5. You read about an ancient hero of the Church and modeled your life after theirs. Once per session, you can reroll a critical failure if you tell a story about your patron saint, martyr, or theologian, and how they were once in a similar situation. The story can be allegorical.
6. Your study of the history's endless churn has left you melancholy. You know all about famous local defeats, deaths, and tragedies. Start with a stout walking stick (as a quarterstaff.)
7. You paid very close attention to the accounts of treasure-hauls and plunder in your book. You can evaluate the approximate value of treasure and loot (as a Thief.)


  **Literature**
8. You memorized large chunks of beautiful prose. You are poetic and sentimental. Start with a basket of flowers.
9. You memorized endless passages of invective, abuse, and slander. You are sarcastic and bitter. Start with a wheelbarrow.
10. You memorized large chunks of poetry. Start with 1 [Camp Follower.](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/06/osr-table-of-camp-followers.html) They are a reminder of you embarrassing love (directly or indirectly.)
11. You read a [very controversial piece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_de_la_Rose) of courtly literature. You either hate it completely and will denounce it at every opportunity, or you will defend it as a work of unrivaled genius and beauty. Either way,  you can make easily find common ground with people who share your view.
12. You have remarkable handwriting. Your script is used as the model for other initiates in your order. Start with 1sp, a quill, and a small pot of ink.
13. You have aspirations to write a great book, poem, commentary, or letter. You have been practicing. Start with 2d10 unfinished drafts on small parchment scraps, stored in a leather bag.


   **Medicine**
   Note: you cannot use this skill to remove Fatal Wounds. This skill is more suited to long-term care and the treatment of disease. You cannot perform surgery, but you might be able to advise a barber-surgeon or a butcher.
14. You tended to the mad. Start with unshakable patience and an iron bell. 
15. You were often at the bedside of the dying, ready with words of comfort. You always know the right thing to say to someone in pain or in the last moments of life. Start with a white cloth.
16. You studied herbs, poultices, and infusions. Few of your remedies have any measurable effect by modern standards, but they are (sometimes) better than nothing. You can name most plants.
17. You have read all the books of medicine written by [the ancient authorities.](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Prognostics) Your treatments might be dangerous or impossible under the circumstances, but you will never fail to recommend a treatment or supply a diagnosis (even if you fail a skill test.)
18. Your abbey sheltered many wounded soldiers during the last [War](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/05/osr-dont-you-know-theres-war-on.html.) You can determine the number of [Fatal Wounds and Current Injuries](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.ca/2017/07/osr-death-and-dismemberment-table-early.html) any person has just by looking at them, and triage appropriately.
19. You have read books of unorthodox medicine from Foreign Parts. If you roll an unmodified 20 on your Medicine skill check, your treatment is instantly and profoundly successful. If you roll an unmodified 1, your treatment makes you a laughingstock and possibly a criminal, provided it is publicized.


   **Religion**
20. You have absolutely unshakable faith. You might be a monomaniacal fanatic or a humble and devout teacher. You gain a +10 to Save vs Demons, mind-altering effects, and despair (but not fear.) If you ever lose faith or commit an act you cannot reconcile, you instead take a -10 penalty to Save (not just vs. demons, all Saves) until you atone or find peace.
21. You are an expert on doctrine and ritual. Start with a gold icon worth 1gp.

22. You studied the lives of the Saints extensively, and have gained some of their natural fortitude and patience. You start with +2 HP and bare feet.
23. You know where to find the most obscure information or greatest living experts, and have spent years cultivating your contacts. You can write a letter to them asking for guidance and receive an answer in 10+1d6 days, exploding on a 6 (if you roll a 6, add another d6, etc..) The answer may not be accurate, but it will be an answer.
24. You personally experienced a [miracle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6LPvSC0KIk.) If you recount the miracle in a serious and moving way, you automatically succeed on your next Charisma test, provided your target would appreciate the story.
25. You either cannot abide luxury and vanity or you are utterly profligate and dissolute. You must Save each day if you have over 10gp or spend all but 10gp on luxuries, alms, etc. Remember, money spent on purely frivolous things nets a +10% XP bonus. If you have no way to spend the money without giving it to another PC, you don't need to Save.

******Special Secret Note**: When you reach level 5, instead of retiring your character or continuing to adventure, you can perform a miracle. You must be in absolutely untarnished standing with the Authority. You may have sinned, but you must be properly, fully, and faithfully atoned. Your GM will only inform you of this option if it is relevant. Under some circumstances, this option may be available earlier. Once the miracle is performed, your character becomes an NPC.

## Class: Engineer

Engineers are crafters of all things non-magical. Some are smiths, some carpenters, some architects, some leatherworkers. They’re always on the watch for useful things that don’t necessarily *seem* useful, and for things to deconstruct for their wonderful bits.

Starting Equipment: leather armor, hammer, scissors, dagger
Starting Skill: see profession below. You also gain the engineer skill when you take your first Engineer template.

**A: Craft, Identify, Salvage**

**B: Repair, Improve**

**C: Traps**

**D: Modify**

You gain 1 blueprint for each Engineer template you possess. Use the process for rolling on the blueprint tables to create each blueprint.

**Templates**

**A:**
**Craft**

When you have access to a market that meets your needs, you may spend 3dx*10 GP (x = expense as determined by the referee) to fill in the gaps in whatever you are trying to build. (Change to 3dx*100 if you hand out gold at a more traditional rate than I do. I use [Skerples' currency](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/09/osr-medieval-price-list.html).)

**Identify**

Identify any non-magical item by examining it for 10 minutes. You can get an inkling of the item's magical purpose if you roll a 1 on a d6 after 10 minutes of examination. (This doesn't apply to purely magical things like spell scrolls, potions, wands, etc.)

**Salvage**

You can deconstruct objects for materials and components. Most materials and components do not use inventory slots. 

**B:**
**Repair**

You may spend 3dx*10 GP (x = expense as determined by the referee) to repair an item. The next two salvage actions gain a broken item generated in the same way as a blueprint. The GM should make sure the item suits the salvage.

There is a 1-in-6 chance of finding a repairable broken item when searching an area that the referee believes might contain such a thing.

**Improve**

Improve any item by one point (only once per item) by paying 50% of the market value of the item. For example, a sword that would sell for 20GP can increase its damage by +1 by paying a cost of 10GP. 

Any weapon improved in this way also improves its breakage rating by one. For example, a fragile weapon would become a standard weapon and a standard weapon would become a masterwork weapon.

**C:**
**Traps**

If it's at all reasonable that a genius engineer could combine the components and items you have into a trap, you can do it. You may spend 3dx*10 GP (x = expense as determined by the referee) to fill in the gaps.

**D:**
**Modify**

Alter items you own if you have learned a way to do so. Blueprints often provide access to a process for modifying items.

If you can explain how you use materials to modify an item in detail and it makes sense, you've modified an item. Anyone can do this, not just engineers. For example: "I'm going to use my glue to attach my string to my pole" results in a string on the end of a pole.

 Blueprint modifications are different. They provide ways to do things that only an expert engineer would understand.

### Professions

|   D4 | Skill         | Additional starting items      |
| ---: | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
|    1 | Architect     | Blank book, ink, quill         |
|    2 | Smith         | Hammer, tongs                  |
|    3 | Carpenter     | Handsaw, hammer, nails         |
|    4 | Leatherworker | Needle, spool of thread, knife |

### Blueprint Generation

**Process**

1. Roll a blueprint type
2. Roll a blueprint verb
3. Roll a blueprint object
4. Describe an item that fits the above results.
5. Start over if the result isn’t interesting or seems impossible to craft. Weird is good. Don’t reroll when it’s weird.

The player character should now be on the watch for items and components that might be used to create something resembling the blueprint. The referee should be somewhat lenient in deciding whether a combination of parts will work. Engineers are brilliant at makeshift, piecemeal improvisation.

If the engineer doesn’t have relevant magical knowledge, their craftsmanship will not apply magic. Use mechanical and physical knowledge instead. They might be able to think of a way to use a magical artifact in the creation of an item, however. If an item seems impossible to craft, roll a different item.

------

**Example 1**

Type: clothing/armor

Verb: gather

Object: poison

A plan to build a glove that extracts poison from the hand of the wearer into a 10ml vial. This glove also reduces the effect of any poison the wearer suffers by 1/2.

Components could include bits of plants or preserved animal bits that can suck, leech, or absorb liquid, piercing objects that might be formed into a syringe or needle, a vial or something similar, a glove, leather, fabric, metal, etc.

The plan doesn’t have to be built exactly to specifications. The player might think of some other way to build something nearly the same as this glove yet different in some way. Don’t spoil that creativity.

**Example 2**

Type: clothing/armor

Verb: defile

Object: thought

A hat that invades the wearer's mind with horrible thoughts they wouldn't normally have.
The engineer might sell the hat to an enemy who would then start having to deal with thoughts opposite to what they would normally think.

An evil, selfish character might keep having great ideas about how to prevent world hunger. A humble priest who only serves the church might start thinking about stealing from the treasury or fantasize about how much fun it would be to claim to be an atheist.
